## README Maturity Model

### Level One: "The Code is the Documentation"
- No/almost no README text of any sort.
- No installation, configuration, running details.
- No developer documentation.
- No complimentary files, such as contributor guidelines.
- No build status information, so there's no insight into the project's current state.
- No suggested average response time to issues and/or pull requests.
- No badges showing code coverage or other quality metrics.
- What text is available may be obsolete or non-priority.

**Recommendation**: Sometimes developers post personal projects and experiments that aren't ready-to-share. In these cases, having little to no documentation may be acceptable. We recommend that the README indicates the nature/status of the project. For example, warn users that "this project is experimental/personal, so use at your own risk."

### Level Two: Bare-Minimum README
- Limited information about what the project is and does with minimal details of its purpose.
- Basic installation, configuration, running details for users, but untested and incomplete.
- Basic or no developer documentation.
- A line in the README about contributions, but no dedicated file.
- A line about the project's build status, though it may be obsolete; or no build status information.
- A line about the average response time to issues and/or pull requests.
- No badges showing code coverage or other quality metrics.
- The text is infrequently updated and may be obsolete or inaccurate.

**Recommendation**: A Level Two README aims for a broad audience, but its incomplete or skeletal nature is likely to cause wasted effort and frustration. Sometimes a Level Two README is worse than having no documentation at all. Include a note stating whether the project is early-stage, unstable, experimental or personal.

### Level Three: Basic README
- Some detailed information about what the project is and does, but none about its purpose.
- Basic installation, configuration, running details for users, tested and complete.
- Basic documentation for potential contributors.
- A vision statement or project roadmap for onboarding new contributors.
- A Contributing.md/.rst file with basic information.
- A line about the project's build status, but minimal: "under development" or "stable."
- A line about the average response time to issues and/or pull requests.
- At least one badge showing code coverage or other quality metrics.
- Text updated at monthly or quarterly intervals, so inaccuracies may exist.

**Recommendation**: A Level Three README is thorough enough to support small-scale community growth. Early-stage projects requiring contributor development should aim to reach this level before publication. Widespread project adoption can happen, although the README might pose barriers.

### Level Four: README with purpose
- Detailed information about the project's purpose, functionality and special features/attributes.
- Detailed user installation, configuration, and running instructions, tested and current. They also include information about common errors and how to resolve them.
- Detailed documentation for potential contributors.
- A detailed vision statement or project roadmap for onboarding new contributors.
- A Contributing.md/.rst file with detailed style guidelines.
- The build status identifies which specific aspects of the project are incomplete and/or causing instability.
- Clear information about the average response time to issues and/or pull requests.
- One or more badges showing code coverage or other quality metrics.
- Text updated at monthly or quarterly intervals, so inaccuracies may exist.

**Recommendation**: A Level Four README can support large-scale community usage and growth. It might lack some ingredients necessary for achieving widespread use and adoption. Corporations that impose stringent standards for adoption might hesitate before using it.

### Level Five: Product-oriented README
- Detailed information about the project's purpose, functionality and special features/attributes. The reader will understand why these features and attributes are helpful or meaningful.
- Includes user testimonials and evidence of past performance in real development situations.
- Detailed user installation, configuration, and running instructions, tested and current. They also include information about common errors and how to resolve them.
- Detailed documentation for potential contributors.
- A detailed vision statement or project roadmap for onboarding new contributors.
- Embedded visual aids like diagrams and demos.
- A Contributing.md/.rst file with detailed style guidelines.
- The build status identifies specific project aspects that are incomplete and/or causing instability.
- Clear information about the average response time to issues and/or pull requests.
- One or more badges showing code coverage or other quality metrics.
- Text updated at weekly or even daily intervals, so inaccuracies are unlikely.

**Recommendation**: Level Five READMEs usually emerge from projects with broad contributor/user bases. Their detail reinforces production-ready use and supervised contributions. Every project should aspire to this level of documentation.
